# Progress Artifacts

This page is the public index for milestone evidence published on
`weaverxslt.org`.

Use it for small, curated public proof of milestone status or debugging claims.
That proof may be either:

- a live page or embedded demo published on `weaverxslt.org`
- a supporting asset such as a screenshot, GIF, `webm`, or `mp4`

Do not use it as a dumping ground for raw working files.

## Storage convention

Live pages do not need files under `docs/assets/progress/`; they can be linked
directly from this index.

- Put assets under `docs/assets/progress/`
- Prefer `webm` or `mp4` for screen recordings when practical
- Use `gif` only when a simple animated image is enough
- Use stable names like `mvp6-devtools-breakpoint.gif`

Published asset URLs will be under:

```text
https://weaverxslt.org/assets/progress/<file>
```

When the proof is a live page instead of a stored asset, link the page URL
directly from this document.

## Planned evidence

### MVP+6.5 Workbench embed

The public workbench prototype is now live on `weaverxslt.org`, with the GIF
capture retained as supporting media.

Current proof:

- live public page on `weaverxslt.org`
- supporting GIF stored under `docs/assets/progress/`

Live URL:

- [MVP+6.5 Workbench live page](https://weaverxslt.org/WORKBENCH/)

Direct link:

- [MVP+6.5 Workbench verification GIF](./assets/progress/mvp65-workbench-live-page.gif)

## Current artifacts

### MVP+6.75 XML node trace debugging

MVP+6.75 is currently closed on executable fixture proof rather than GIF or
video media.

Current proof:

- executable workbench fixture coverage for the tracked-node user story in
	`test/workbench.test.ts`
- parity trace coverage across interpreter, native direct, and native emitted
	execution in `test/trace.test.ts`
- public engine-contract note in [XML_NODE_DEBUGGING.md](./XML_NODE_DEBUGGING.md)

The key demonstrated user story is: track a specific input `<para>` node,
pause when that exact node enters a matched template or becomes the current
focus, and surface a structured pause payload with template/instruction
provenance.

### MVP+6.5 Workbench embed

The live public workbench is available here:

- [MVP+6.5 Workbench live page](https://weaverxslt.org/WORKBENCH/)

Supporting media is also stored in-repo for milestone evidence. This GIF shows
the public workbench prototype running with prefilled XML and XSLT, visible
generated TypeScript, and the rendered output pane updating on the same page.

### MVP+6 DevTools source-map verification

This GIF shows the full manual acceptance flow from
[DEVTOOLS_CHECKLIST.md](./DEVTOOLS_CHECKLIST.md):

- `demo.xsl` visible in DevTools `Sources`
- breakpoint set on `xsl:value-of`
- render button clicked
- execution pausing on the authored stylesheet line
