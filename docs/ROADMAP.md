# Roadmap — MVP and increments

> Execution plan, not a spec. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for
> pinned design decisions and [DIFFERENTIATORS.md](./DIFFERENTIATORS.md)
> for the product thesis. See [XPATH.md](./XPATH.md) for the XPath-specific
> implementation strategy that informs M1, M2, and M7.
>
> Each increment is **shippable on its own**: it compiles, it tests green,
> it demonstrates *something* a user could see. Nothing here is "do a lot
> of work then flip a switch."
>
> Every increment is bounded by its **exit criteria**. A box unchecked =
> the increment is not done, regardless of elapsed effort. We do not
> redefine "done" to make dates.

## Ground rules (apply to every increment)

1. **Diagnostics-first** (DEC-013). No feature is complete without good
   errors. An increment with passing conformance tests but cryptic errors
   is rejected.
2. **Both backends, same tests** (DEC-010). Once the codegen exists (MVP+4),
   every new feature must pass under interpreter *and* codegen before the
   increment closes.
3. **IR changes are reviewable diffs.** Generated code fixtures are checked
   into `test/generated-fixtures/` from MVP+4 onward. IR version ticks when
   it changes.
4. **No green tests, no merge.** Typecheck + lint + unit + conformance
   (scoped to the increment) all pass in CI.
5. **No increment bleeds features from the next.** If something feels
   necessary that's scheduled later, write it down as a scope-creep note
   and leave it alone.

---

## MVP (M0–M3): the interpreter walking skeleton

The MVP is **four increments**. At the end, we can run a real, small XSLT
against real XML and get real output with real error messages. No codegen
yet. No CLI yet. Just: the thing works end-to-end in TypeScript.

### MVP+0 — scaffold (done)

**Goal:** repo exists, builds, tests green, W3C suites visible.

**Deliverables (complete):**
- [x] `@arakendo/xslt` npm scaffold, strict TS, ESM, Node 20+
- [x] Vitest + ESLint 9 + Prettier + CI matrix (Ubuntu/Windows × Node 20/22)
- [x] MIT license, CONTRIBUTING, closed-contributions governance
- [x] Layered `src/` (errors, xml, xdm, xpath/{lex,parse,eval}, xslt/{compile,eval}, processor)
- [x] `@xmldom/xmldom` BOM-stripping parser wrapper
- [x] W3C submodules (`xslt30-test`, `qt3tests`) with VS Code isolation
- [x] Catalog walker discovering 14,600 XSLT cases + 31,821 QT3 cases
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md + DIFFERENTIATORS.md with pinned DEC-001..015
- [x] Public API stubs throwing "not yet implemented"

**Exit criteria:** `npm run typecheck && npm test` green. ✅

---

### MVP+1 — XPath vertical slice + diagnostic bones (done)

**Goal:** evaluate `1 + 2`, `//foo`, `foo/bar[1]` against a DOM with
source-located AST and caret-formatted errors. This is where the
diagnostics-first culture gets built in; everything after inherits it.

**Scope (in):**
- Hand-written lexer (`src/xpath/lex/lexer.ts`) with **every token carrying
  a full `SourceSpan`** compatible with `docs/ERRORS.md` (`uri`, UTF-16
  offsets, start/end line + column). No exceptions.
- Recursive-descent parser (`src/xpath/parse/parser.ts`) + Pratt operator
  precedence for `+ - * div mod`, `= != < <= > >=`, `and or`, unary `-`
- AST node kinds: `NumberLiteral`, `StringLiteral`, `PathExpr`,
  `StepExpr` (axis + node-test + predicates), `BinaryOp`, `UnaryOp`,
  `ContextItem` (`.`), `VariableRef` (`$x`)
- Node-tests: `name`, `*`, `text()`, `node()`
- Axes: `child`, `descendant`, `descendant-or-self`, `self`, `attribute`
  (+ their abbreviations `/`, `//`, `@`)
- Evaluator over `XdmNode`-wrapped DOM; sequence results use the engine-owned
  `Sequence` abstraction rather than exposing naked JS iterables
- `DiagnosticReport` introduced as the canonical boundary shape, plus
  `XdmError -> DiagnosticReport` conversion and a small invariant checker
  for spans/classification basics
- `src/diagnostics/` module: `formatDiagnostic(report, sourceText)` produces
  the caret format documented in D1
- Error taxonomy: `XPathError extends XdmError` with W3C codes
  (`XPST0003` parse, `XPDY0002` no context, `XPTY0004` type mismatch)

**Scope (out, called out on purpose):**
- String/numeric type coercion rules beyond integer + decimal + string
- Function calls (deferred to MVP+2)
- Namespaces (expanded-QNames) — deferred to MVP+3
- Value-comparison (`eq`/`ne`) — deferred to MVP+2; only general-comparison
  in this slice
- Pulling M7 type-system semantics forward because one function/operator
  looks easy in isolation

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Unit tests cover every AST kind + every axis + every operator
- [x] One golden error-format test: a known-bad expression produces a
      byte-exact expected diagnostic string
- [x] `DiagnosticReport` snapshots exist for at least one parse failure
  and one runtime type failure; both pass invariant validation
- [x] Evaluating `//book/title[1]/text()` over a fixture doc returns the
      first book's title text
- [x] QT3 conformance runner **filters to the slice** (arithmetic +
      path + predicates only) and reports a real pass rate, not "0 skipped"
- [x] Every XPath-layer failure can be converted into a `DiagnosticReport`
  with a populated primary span

**Completed notes:**
- Focused XPath tests cover the implemented AST, axis, operator, and predicate slice.
- `src/diagnostics/` now provides `DiagnosticReport` conversion, invariant validation,
  and caret formatting.
- A curated QT3 MVP+1 slice executes against vendor cases and currently reports `6/6` passing.

---

### MVP+2 — XPath core on interpreter (in progress)

**Goal:** pass a meaningful chunk of the QT3 suite. "Meaningful" = the
sequence/atomization rules are right, or everything downstream is cursed
(hazard H2).

**Started slice:**
- Function-call AST + arity-based dispatch is now seeded in-tree.
- Zero-argument `position()` and `last()` support works inside predicates.
- `count()`, `exists()`, and `empty()` now work over evaluated sequences.
- `boolean()` and `not()` now reuse effective-boolean-value semantics over evaluated sequences.
- `true()`, `false()`, `abs()`, `floor()`, `ceiling()`, and `round()` now work through the shared function dispatch path.
- `string()`, `string-length()`, `number()`, `data()`, and `root()` now work through local string-value and atomization helpers.
- `name()` and `local-name()` now work for singleton node arguments.
- `reverse()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `subsequence()` now work over evaluated sequences.
- `concat()`, `normalize-space()`, `contains()`, `starts-with()`, `ends-with()`, `upper-case()`, and `lower-case()` now work through the shared string-value helpers.
- `substring()` and `string-join()` now work through the same string-value path.
- `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `avg()` now work over atomized numeric sequences.
- `distinct-values()` now works over atomized sequences.
- `matches()`, `replace()`, and `tokenize()` now have an initial ECMAScript-compatible regex slice; the schema-regex translator is still pending.
- The `to` operator now has an initial integer-only range-expression slice.
- `()` and comma-separated parenthesized expressions now have an initial sequence-constructor slice.
- `if (...) then ... else ...` now has an initial flow-expression slice.
- Value comparison operators `eq ne lt le gt ge` are now distinct from general comparison,
  including a first type-error guard for mismatched singleton operands.
- The `parent` axis is now available via both `..` and `parent::`.
- The `ancestor` and `ancestor-or-self` axes are now available through named axis syntax.
- Node comparison operators `is`, `<<`, and `>>` now work for singleton-node identity and order checks.
- The `following-sibling`, `preceding-sibling`, `following`, and `preceding` axes now work, including reverse-axis predicate ordering.
- This is only the opening slice for MVP+2, not increment completion.

**Scope (in):**
- Remaining axes: `parent`, `ancestor`, `ancestor-or-self`, `following`,
  `following-sibling`, `preceding`, `preceding-sibling`, `namespace`
- **Value comparison** (`eq ne lt le gt ge`) + **node comparison** (`is`,
  `<<`, `>>`) alongside general comparison
- Atomization rules; sequence-of-one vs singleton semantics
- Flow expressions: `if/then/else`, `for ... return`, `let ... return`,
  `some/every ... satisfies`
- Range expression `1 to 10`, sequence constructor `(a, b, c)`
- ~40 built-in functions (`fn:` namespace):
  `string, number, boolean, not, count, sum, concat, substring,
  string-length, normalize-space, contains, starts-with, ends-with,
  upper-case, lower-case, position, last, name, local-name,
  node-name, exists, empty, distinct-values, min, max, avg, floor,
  ceiling, round, abs, true, false, data, root, tokenize, matches,
  replace, string-join, reverse, subsequence, head, tail`
- Function-call AST + overload-resolution-by-arity (SequenceType matching
  is MVP+7; for now, arity only)
- Regex translator (schema-regex → ECMAScript regex) for `matches/replace/tokenize`
- Structured diagnostic details for the common XPath failures in this
  increment (`expectedType`, `actualType`, `functionName`, `axis`,
  context/focus failures) so formatter output is backed by stable fields

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] **20% of QT3 "required" tests passing** (baseline real conformance %)
- [ ] No comparison operator (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `eq`,
  `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `is`, `<<`, `>>`) lands without:
  at least 3 cross-type tests and at least 1 sequence-based test
- [ ] Atomization tests: `1 eq '1'` → type error with clear message,
      not a silent `false`
- [ ] `position()` and `last()` inside predicates work correctly against
      nested paths
- [ ] Regex translator has its own fixture suite (inputs from W3C regex
      examples, outputs = ECMAScript source strings)
- [ ] Error messages show the *subexpression* that failed, not just the
      whole expression
- [ ] Required-detail validation exists for at least the codes the engine
  materially depends on in this slice (`XPTY0004`, `XPST0017`, etc.)

---

### MVP+3 — XSLT MVP on interpreter (first green transform)

**Goal:** run a real (tiny) invoice stylesheet end-to-end. This is the
first moment `@arakendo/xslt` does what it says on the tin.

**Scope (in):**
- Stylesheet loader: parse `.xsl` via `@xmldom/xmldom`, emit IR via
  `src/xslt/compile/compiler.ts`
- Priority mini-spec written before template dispatch lands: default
  priority rules, built-in template rules, conflict resolution, and at
  least 3 overlapping-pattern examples captured as executable fixtures
- IR node kinds (plain-data, source-located, versioned — DEC-005):
  `Stylesheet, Template, ApplyTemplates, ValueOf, ForEach, Choose,
  When, Otherwise, If, Variable, Param, LiteralResultElement,
  LiteralText, Sequence`
- Template dispatch: match-pattern matching, default priority rules,
  built-in template rules (identity-ish default for root + text)
- XPath expressions inside attributes/`select=` are parsed via MVP+2
  engine and source-located back to the stylesheet offset (not just the
  expression offset)
- Output: tree build into a result DOM, then serialized via a basic
  XML serializer (`src/xslt/serialize/xml.ts`) — entities escaped,
  attributes quoted, no pretty-printing required
- Namespace handling (just enough): expanded-QNames for element/attribute
  names; `xmlns` declarations preserved in LREs
- Runtime diagnostic frames and related spans for template, instruction,
  caller chain, and enclosing match/select context
- Golden test harness flips on: `test/golden/hello/` (literal result),
  `test/golden/invoice-simple/` (apply-templates + value-of), others
  expected to grow

**Scope (out):**
- `xsl:mode`, `xsl:key`, `xsl:accumulator`, `xsl:iterate`, `xsl:merge`
- `xsl:import`/`xsl:include` (later — namespace + priority resolution is
  its own project)
- `xsl:number`, `xsl:sort` (deferred to +6 block)
- Output methods other than `xml` (`html`, `text`, `json` deferred)
- Schema-aware anything

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] At least 3 goldens under `test/golden/` pass byte-exact
- [ ] Overlapping-pattern and default-priority fixtures exist and are
  named in the priority mini-spec; no "mostly right" dispatch
  behavior ships without those examples going green
- [ ] XSLT conformance runner filtered to the supported feature set
      reports a non-trivial pass rate
- [ ] A runtime error in an `<xsl:value-of select="...">` prints:
      stylesheet file + line + column, the offending subexpression with
      caret, the enclosing template's match pattern, and a call chain
      back to `apply-templates` (D1 requirement, not a nice-to-have)
- [ ] At least one XSLT runtime-failure fixture snapshots the structured
  `DiagnosticReport` including `frames` and `related` spans, not only
  the formatted text
- [ ] README has a working "hello world" copy-paste example

**This is the MVP.** Everything after this is increments.

---

## MVP+4 — codegen backend v1 (the product)

**Goal:** compile the MVP+3 feature set to readable, debuggable
TypeScript. The interpreter stays; it is no longer the product, it is the
reference. Hazard H3 (codegen exposes every IR mistake) cashes in here —
we should expect to rev the IR whenever codegen exposes a missing semantic.

**Scope (in):**
- `src/xslt/codegen/emit.ts` — pure function `IR → string` (if it needs
  side effects, **fix the IR, not the backend** — mantra)
- Evaluation order, context state, and variable lifetime are treated as
  IR contract problems, not "codegen special cases". If codegen feels
  clever, stop and repair the IR first.
- Generated module shape:
  ```ts
  // invoice.xsl.ts (generated from invoice.xsl)
  import type { TransformContext, XmlWriter } from '@arakendo/xslt/runtime';
  export const source = { path: 'invoice.xsl', digest: '...' };
  export function transform(input: Document, ctx: TransformContext): string {
    // match="/" (invoice.xsl:1)
    // ...
  }
  ```
- `src/runtime/` — the minimal runtime the generated code imports: XPath
  kernel (re-exported from the interpreter's evaluator core), serializer,
  `TransformContext`. This is what ships alongside generated code.
- Generated runtime helpers reconstruct equivalent structured diagnostics
  rather than collapsing failures to prose-only strings
- JSDoc provenance comments on every dispatch: `/** match="invoice" (invoice.xsl:12) */`
- `test/generated-fixtures/` — generated `.ts` for every golden checked in
  so IR changes surface as PR diffs
- Fixture harness: compiles each golden twice (interpreter, codegen),
  asserts byte-equal output
- CLI stub: `node dist/cli.js compile <file>` writes `<file>.ts`. Not yet
  the shipped CLI, but real enough to dogfood.

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Every MVP+3 golden passes under codegen (byte-equal to interpreter)
- [ ] Generated fixtures exist and are human-reviewable
- [ ] A generated file runs without importing the *compiler* — only
      `@arakendo/xslt/runtime`. (Test: delete everything except runtime
      + generated files in a sandbox, execute, see output.)
- [ ] IR version is documented; any IR schema change requires updating
      `src/xslt/compile/ir.ts` version constant
- [ ] Diagnostic parity fixtures compare interpreter and codegen
  `DiagnosticReport` values for representative runtime and compile-time
  failures; parity is on structure first, formatter text second
- [ ] Sanity check: set a breakpoint in the generated TS in VS Code
      debugger, run a test, breakpoint hits, `ctx` is inspectable

---

## MVP+5 — typed params, typed extension functions, CLI

**Goal:** XSLT becomes a good citizen of the TS ecosystem. The pitch
"call your stylesheet like a typed function" starts working here.

**Scope (in):**
- `.d.ts` emission alongside every `.xsl.ts`. Signatures derived from
  `<xsl:param as="...">` declarations. Mapping:
  `xs:string → string`, `xs:integer → number`, `xs:boolean → boolean`,
  `xs:double → number`, element/document → `Element | Document`, sequences
  → arrays, optional params → optional properties
- Shipped `arakendo-xslt` CLI:
  - `arakendo-xslt compile <glob>` → writes `.xsl.ts` + `.d.ts` + digest
  - `arakendo-xslt run <stylesheet> --input <xml>` → runs via interpreter
  - `arakendo-xslt --help` is not garbage
- `defineXsltFunctions('ns', { ... })` — typed extension function
  registration. At compile time, the compiler loads a `functions.ts`
  file (optional, convention-based), reads the TS signatures via the TS
  compiler API, and type-checks calls in the stylesheet against them.
- Mismatched arg types → compile-time diagnostic pointing at the
  stylesheet call site, not the TS file

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Typed invocation works in a fixture React-ish project (under
      `test/integration/react-app/` — just a tsconfig + one import +
      one call). `tsc` passes on the consumer side.
- [ ] Extension-function type-mismatch produces a stylesheet-located
      diagnostic with the `.ts` signature quoted inline
- [ ] CLI published as `arakendo-xslt` bin entry in `package.json`
- [ ] `arakendo-xslt compile` is documented in README with a copy-paste
      that works

---

## MVP+6 — watch mode + source maps + diagnostics v2 (D5)

**Goal:** the modern-dev-loop pitch becomes real. Without this, D2 and
D3 are theoretical.

Rule of engagement: **watch correctness beats watch speed**. A 500 ms
rebuild that serves stale output or stale diagnostics is a failed increment.

**Scope (in):**
- `arakendo-xslt watch <glob>`: chokidar-based, sub-second recompile on
  save, writes outputs atomically, streams diagnostics to stdout in the
  D1 caret format
- Persistent IR cache keyed by `{ path, mtime, digest }` so only changed
  stylesheets recompile
- `.xsl.map` source-map emission so Chrome/VS Code debuggers step through
  the `.xsl`, not the generated `.ts`. Test: breakpoint set on
  `invoice.xsl:42` actually hits
- **Static-analysis pass** (`src/xslt/compile/analyze.ts`), runs on every
  compile, produces diagnostics for:
  - Unreachable templates (another template always matches first)
  - Unused variables / params / templates / modes
  - Priority conflicts (two templates with same priority + overlapping
    patterns)
  - Typos in element/attribute names when a sample document is supplied
    (`prodcut` → `did you mean 'product'?`) — Levenshtein-based
  - Typos in function names against the known `fn:` registry + any
    `defineXsltFunctions` registrations
- Bundler plugins (thin wrappers over the compiler):
  - `@arakendo/xslt/vite` — `import './invoice.xsl'` works in Vite dev
  - `@arakendo/xslt/esbuild` — same for esbuild / tsup
- JSON-safe diagnostic projection available for future editor/CLI
  boundaries without inventing a second report contract

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] `arakendo-xslt watch` round-trips under 500ms for a 200-line stylesheet
- [ ] Watch invalidation fixtures prove that editing a dependency updates
  emitted `.xsl.ts`, `.d.ts`, `.xsl.map`, and diagnostics together;
  no stale-output or stale-diagnostic regressions
- [ ] Watch-mode output and any JSON projection originate from the same
      underlying `DiagnosticReport` values; no formatter-specific data loss
- [ ] Chrome DevTools shows the `.xsl` in the source tree and stops on
      breakpoints (manual verification recorded as a GIF in the PR)
- [ ] Each static-analysis rule has a fixture of its own in
      `test/analyze/` with an expected diagnostic
- [ ] At least one of the bundler plugins has an integration test

---

## MVP+7 — XPath type system + maps + arrays + higher-order

**Goal:** close the XPath 3.1 feature gap that the MVP skipped. This is
XPath maturity work; XSLT-visible features are mostly additive.

Entry gate: do not start this increment while MVP+4 through MVP+6 still
have unresolved parity bugs, stale-watch bugs, or diagnostic regressions.
This increment is a brain-burner already; it does not get to coexist with
foundational instability.

**Scope (in):**
- `cast as`, `castable as`, `instance of` with full SequenceType grammar
- Numeric type tower: `xs:integer`, `xs:decimal`, `xs:double`,
  `xs:float`, with the full promotion/subtype rules (and the diagnostics
  that make getting them wrong understandable)
- Maps: `map { 'k': 'v' }`, `map:get`, `map:put`, `map:keys`, etc.
- Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`, `array:get`, `array:size`, etc.
- Higher-order functions: function items, `function(...) { ... }`
  inline functions, function-reference `fn-name#1`, `fold-left`,
  `fold-right`, `for-each`, `filter`, `sort`
- SequenceType-based overload resolution (upgrades MVP+2's arity-only
  resolution)
- Full `fn:*` library: all ~220 functions defined by XPath/XQuery 3.1 F&O

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] QT3 pass rate ≥60% on the required tests
- [ ] SequenceType errors produce diagnostics naming the expected and
      actual sequence types with occurrence indicators (`*`, `+`, `?`)
- [ ] Map + array examples work end-to-end in a golden test

---

## MVP+8 — XSLT 3.0 feature-complete (non-streaming)

**Goal:** the engine is actually an XSLT 3.0 engine, not an MVP subset.

**Scope (in):**
- `xsl:mode` (declared modes, on-no-match, visibility)
- `xsl:key` + `fn:key()` — with indexed lookup, not naive scan
- `xsl:accumulator` + `fn:accumulator-before/after`
- `xsl:iterate` + `xsl:next-iteration` + `xsl:break`
- `xsl:merge`
- `xsl:number` (count, from, level, format)
- `xsl:sort` (full collation-aware implementation later, stable sort now)
- `xsl:import` + `xsl:include` with precedence resolution
- `xsl:import-schema` — parse-only, no validation (still non-goal)
- Packages: `xsl:package`, `xsl:use-package`, visibility attributes
- Output methods: `xml`, `html`, `text`, `json`
- Serialization parameters: `indent`, `omit-xml-declaration`, `encoding`,
  `doctype-public/system`, `cdata-section-elements`

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] All features pass conformance tests **under both backends**
- [ ] IR additions are documented with IR version bump
- [ ] Generated code for `xsl:iterate` is still readable (if not, hazard H3
      is screaming — fix the IR)

---

## MVP+9 — conformance push

**Goal:** credibility. An honest, publicly-reported conformance number.

**Scope (in):**
- Conformance dashboard: per-category pass rate (XPath / XSLT /
  serialization / patterns), published to a GitHub Pages site
- Failure triage: every skipped/failing test tagged with a reason code
  (`unimplemented-feature`, `spec-ambiguity`, `bug`, `harness-issue`)
- Focused bug-fix sweeps driven by the dashboard, not by vibes

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] ≥70% of XSLT 3.0 required tests passing under **both** backends
- [ ] ≥80% of QT3 required tests passing under both backends
- [ ] Zero "unknown failure" — every failing test has a tagged reason
- [ ] Public dashboard live at `arakendo.github.io/xslt3` (or equivalent)

---

## MVP+10 — practical streaming subset

**Goal:** handle inputs that don't fit in memory, without attempting the
full XSLT 3.0 streamability analysis (non-goal). Treat this as a second
execution model with shared semantics, not a bolt-on optimization pass.

**Scope (in):**
- Opt-in per stylesheet: `<xsl:stylesheet streaming="forward-only">`
  (our attribute, not a spec one — documented clearly)
- Constraints enforced at compile time via the static-analysis pass:
  no backwards navigation (`parent::`, `preceding::`, `//`-from-root),
  no `last()`, no multi-pass accumulators
- Streaming codegen backend that emits a SAX-like state machine instead
  of a DOM-walking function
- Violations are compile-time diagnostics with a suggested rewrite when
  possible

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] A 1 GB XML input streams through a fixture stylesheet with bounded
      memory (< 100 MB resident)
- [ ] Every streaming constraint violation is a compile-time diagnostic,
      not a runtime surprise
- [ ] Non-streaming stylesheets are **unaffected** — no perf regression
      on the existing goldens

---

## MVP+11 — `<ts:eval>` escape hatch (gated)

**Goal:** D4, finally, with discipline intact.

**Scope (in):**
- `features: { tsEval: true }` required at compile time; default off
- `<ts:eval>` body parsed as TypeScript via `typescript` compiler API,
  type-checked against a generated `ctx` type derived from stylesheet
  params + visible variables + the narrow runtime surface
- Body inlined into generated code with source-map fidelity — breakpoints
  set in the `<ts:eval>` block work in DevTools
- Lint warning when `<ts:eval>` content volume exceeds a configurable
  ratio of total stylesheet content (default 25%)
- Deliberate non-features: no `ctx.applyTemplates`, no
  `ctx.compileXPath`, no template dispatch inside `<ts:eval>`

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Type errors inside `<ts:eval>` surface with stylesheet location
- [ ] A golden where `<ts:eval>` calls `Intl.NumberFormat` and round-trips
      under both backends (codegen-native; interpreter invokes via a
      `new Function`-free host shim)
- [ ] Over-use lint has its own fixture
- [ ] README and DIFFERENTIATORS both link the D4 discipline section

---

## MVP+12 — polish, performance, 1.0

**Goal:** earn the right to say `1.0`.

**Scope (in):**
- Performance pass: microbenchmarks for XPath evaluator hot paths,
  codegen output tightening (dead-code elimination, constant folding in
  the IR, predicate-to-index hoisting for `xsl:key`)
- Documentation site: generated from `.md` sources + TypeDoc for the
  runtime API
- Migration guide for Saxon-JS users (side-by-side comparison, call-out
  of differences — *not* a compat promise)
- `xsl:evaluate` under interpreter backend only, documented as such
- Semantic versioning commitment formalized in `VERSIONING.md`
- `1.0.0` published to npm under the `@arakendo/xslt` scope

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Docs site live
- [ ] Performance regression CI in place (bench results tracked commit-over-commit)
- [ ] Public 1.0 announcement ready (blog post, whatever channel)
- [ ] A real-world stylesheet we did not write compiles cleanly, passes,
      and the user can step through it in DevTools

---

## Review checkpoints

Between each increment, a short retrospective (one doc paragraph is fine):

1. Which hazards (H1–H4) got closer? Which got worse?
2. Did the IR change? If yes, bump version and note why.
3. What got deferred? Add to scope-creep log.
4. Did any diagnostic regress? If yes, stop and fix before the next
   increment starts.
5. Did any semantic boundary weaken? Check against
  [SEMANTIC_BOUNDARIES.md](./SEMANTIC_BOUNDARIES.md): lexical vs
  resolved identity, plain contract objects vs overlays/plans,
  relation-type separation, and interpreter/codegen parity.

The roadmap is updated as we go. An increment's exit criteria are not
edited downward during the increment — only between increments, and only
with a recorded reason.
